# Decision Support System for University Selection

## Objective
This project builds a Decision Support System (DSS) to help prospective graduate students
evaluate and rank universities based on multiple criteria such as GRE score, tuition,
cost of living, student–faculty ratio, and job placement outcomes.

## Dataset
- Source: Compiled university-level data across multiple academic branches
- Records: ~1,400 universities
- Key features:
  - GRE
  - Tuition per semester
  - Cost of living
  - Student–faculty ratio
  - Job placement (or) alumni success
  - Branch

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing (Python, pandas)
2. Handling missing values using business-driven logic
3. Normalization of decision criteria
4. Weighted scoring model for university ranking
5. Export of final scores for visualization in Power BI

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI (for dashboard visualization)

## Output
- Cleaned dataset
- Ranked list of universities based on user-defined preferences
- Interactive Power BI dashboard for scenario analysis
